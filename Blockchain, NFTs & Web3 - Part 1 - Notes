# Blockchain, NFTs & Web3 - Part 1 - Notes

### Slide 4 - Important Terms
Blockchain - Immutable Distributed Ledger - A spreadsheet that lives on lots of decentralized computers (think torrents like Napster or Limewire) and where you can only add lines (think subtraction via addition). Also, there is a cost to making changes by adding lines.
Technical definition: “A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.” 

Proof of Work - Proof of work (PoW) is a form of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) proves to others (the verifiers) that a certain amount of a specific computational effort has been expended. Verifiers can subsequently confirm this expenditure with minimal effort on their part. (A key feature of proof-of-work schemes is their asymmetry: the work – the computation – must be moderately hard (yet feasible) on the prover or requester side but easy to check for the verifier or service provider).

How is Ethereum different from Bitcoin? “Bitcoin's primary use case is as a store of value and a digital currency. Ether can also be used as a digital currency and store of value, but the Ethereum network also makes it possible to create and run decentralized applications and smart contracts. Blocks are validated approximately every 12 seconds on Ethereum as opposed to approximately every 10 minutes on Bitcoin.” Ethereum = World Computer
