# Blockchain, NFTs & Web3 - Part 1 - Introduction - Notes

## Slide 4 - Important Terms

**Blockchain** - Immutable Distributed Ledger - A spreadsheet that lives on lots of decentralized computers (think torrents like Napster or Limewire) and where you can only add lines (think subtraction via addition). Also, there is a cost to making changes by adding lines.

Technical definition: “A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.” 

*Proof of Work* - Proof of work (PoW) is a form of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) proves to others (the verifiers) that a certain amount of a specific computational effort has been expended. Verifiers can subsequently confirm this expenditure with minimal effort on their part. (A key feature of proof-of-work schemes is their asymmetry: the work – the computation – must be moderately hard (yet feasible) on the prover or requester side but easy to check for the verifier or service provider).

[How is Ethereum different from Bitcoin?](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) “Bitcoin's primary use case is as a store of value and a digital currency. Ether can also be used as a digital currency and store of value, but the Ethereum network also makes it possible to create and run decentralized applications and smart contracts. Blocks are validated approximately every 12 seconds on Ethereum as opposed to approximately every 10 minutes on Bitcoin.” *Ethereum = World Computer.* [Ethereum is a second generation blockchain.](https://blog.bitnovo.com/en/what-is-second-generation-blockchain/)

**NFTs** - [see linked graphic](https://c.neevacdn.net/image/fetch/s--XXfyrGpA--/https%3A//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JJnNBWlP6wA/XLSOQTNrHQI/AAAAAAAAApw/zkeY0XfpXgUQAYZ4BpmcqaE1Lm70oq_ngCK8BGAs/s0/DIFFERENCES%252BBETWEEN%252B%252BFUNGIBLE%252BAND%252BNON-FUNGIBLE%252BTOKENS%252B.png?savepath=DIFFERENCES+BETWEEN++FUNGIBLE+AND+NON-FUNGIBLE+TOKENS+.png).

**Web 1 vs 2 vs 3** - see references [1](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-Web-1-0-Web-2-0-and-Web-3-0-What-are-some-examples), [2](https://enlear.academy/web-1-0-vs-web-2-0-vs-web-3-0-e428cfe09dde), [3](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/web2-vs-web3/) & [4](https://www.notboring.co/p/web3-use-cases-today). Quick caveat - we are at Web 2.5. Still not seamless. Most communication and coordination still occurs at the Web 2 level. Web 3 tools are coming: e.g. [nfty chat](https://nftychat.xyz/) and [Lens Protocol](https://lens.xyz/).

**Wallet** - Crypto wallets keep your private keys – the passwords that give you access to your cryptocurrencies – safe and accessible, allowing you to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They come in many forms, from hardware wallets like Ledger (which looks like a USB stick) to mobile apps. Unlike a normal wallet, which can hold actual cash, crypto wallets technically don’t store your crypto. Your holdings live on the blockchain, but can only be accessed using a private key. Your keys prove your ownership of your digital money and allow you to make transactions. If you lose your private keys, you lose access to your money.

**Exchange** - Allow you to trade fiat currency for cryptocurrency.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiat currency - fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity, such as gold or silver, but rather by the  government that issued it.

Bridge - Allow you to move crypto from a layer-1 to a layer-2 network.

Layer-2 networks sit on top of layer-1 networks. Usually, layer 2s are faster and cheaper 
than the base layer of the blockchain. Sometimes, they can do things that layer-2 blockchains cannot, such as accept assets from other layer-1 blockchains.

DeFi - offers financial instruments without relying on intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks by using smart contracts on a blockchain. 

dApp - A decentralized application is an application that can operate autonomously, typically through the use of smart contracts, that runs on a decentralized computing, blockchain or other distributed ledger system.

Smart Contract - a computer program or a transaction protocol which is intended to automatically execute, control or document legally relevant events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. The objectives of smart contracts are the reduction of need in trusted intermediators, arbitrations and enforcement costs, fraud losses, as well as the reduction of malicious and accidental exceptions. Vending machines are mentioned as the oldest piece of technology equivalent to smart contract implementation.

DAO - is an organization constructed by rules encoded as a computer program that is often transparent, controlled by the organization's members and not influenced by a central government, in other words they are member-owned communities without centralized leadership. A DAO's financial transaction records and program rules are maintained on a blockchain. The precise legal status of this type of business organization is unclear.

A well-known example, intended for venture capital funding, was The DAO, which amassed 3.6 million ether (ETH)—Ethereum's mining reward—then worth more than US$70 million in May 2016, and was hacked and drained of US$50 million in cryptocurrency weeks later. The hack was reversed in the following weeks, and the money restored, via a hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain. Most Ethereum miners and clients switched to the new fork while the original chain became Ethereum Classic.

Metaverse - “The metaverse is a set of interconnected, interoperable virtual spaces with digital economies where you can create and explore with other people who aren’t in the same physical space.”

While Web 3 is more about the backend of the internet, its infrastructure, how it is accessed, and content ownership, the Metaverse is about how the internet of the future will be experienced.
The term ‘Metaverse’ was first used by sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson in his novel “Snow Crash” to describe a 3D virtual space. 

Examples include Decentraland, Horizon Worlds, and The Sandbox. Will there be one metaverse or many?

Whale - A Whale is someone who has a lot of money and can change the market dynamic for a project by buying a lot of assets or purchasing assets at a significant price. 

Degen - short for degenerate. Term of affection - comes from “degenerate gambler.”

Alpha - best described as “intel”. Those who possess alpha have information that the rest of the market hasn’t found out about yet.
