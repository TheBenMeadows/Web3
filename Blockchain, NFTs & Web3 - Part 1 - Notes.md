# Blockchain, NFTs & Web3 - Part 1 - Introduction - Notes

## Slide 4 - Important Terms

**Blockchain** - Immutable Distributed Ledger - A spreadsheet that lives on lots of decentralized computers (think torrents like Napster or Limewire) and where you can only add lines (think subtraction via addition). Also, there is a cost to making changes by adding lines.

Technical definition: “A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.” 

*Proof of Work* - Proof of work (PoW) is a form of cryptographic proof in which one party (the prover) proves to others (the verifiers) that a certain amount of a specific computational effort has been expended. Verifiers can subsequently confirm this expenditure with minimal effort on their part. (A key feature of proof-of-work schemes is their asymmetry: the work – the computation – must be moderately hard (yet feasible) on the prover or requester side but easy to check for the verifier or service provider).

How is Ethereum different from Bitcoin? “Bitcoin's primary use case is as a store of value and a digital currency. Ether can also be used as a digital currency and store of value, but the Ethereum network also makes it possible to create and run decentralized applications and smart contracts. Blocks are validated approximately every 12 seconds on Ethereum as opposed to approximately every 10 minutes on Bitcoin.” Ethereum = World Computer

**NFTs** - see attached.

**Web 1 vs 2 vs 3** - see references sheet. Quick caveat - we are at Web 2.5. Still not seamless. Most communication and coordination still occurs at the Web 2 level. Web 3 tools are coming: e.g. nftychat.xyz and lens.xyz (lens protocol).

**Wallet** - Crypto wallets keep your private keys – the passwords that give you access to your cryptocurrencies – safe and accessible, allowing you to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They come in many forms, from hardware wallets like Ledger (which looks like a USB stick) to mobile apps. Unlike a normal wallet, which can hold actual cash, crypto wallets technically don’t store your crypto. Your holdings live on the blockchain, but can only be accessed using a private key. Your keys prove your ownership of your digital money and allow you to make transactions. If you lose your private keys, you lose access to your money.
