# Lesson 2 - Basic Tools for Creating AI Art

**Summary** - In this lesson, we will look at the top three AI systems for creating art from text prompts: DALL-E 2, Midjourney & Stable Diffusion. We will touch on how they actually produce images. We will also discuss how they are similar, as well as the ways in which they differ. We will also discuss how to access and use each of these systems, as well as look briefly at some other alternatives, and new advancements that are on the horizon.

# Lesson 3 - Tools & Workflows for AI Art (Part 1)

**Summary** - In this lesson, we will take a look an in-depth look at creating AI art using Midjourney and Stable Diffusion (and we may even create a piece live!). We will cover concepts such as prompt engineering, image prompting, inpainting, outpainting, upscaling, using different models/checkpoints, and using ControlNet.

# Lesson 4 - Tools & Workflows for AI Art (Part 2)

**Summary** - In this lesson, we will continue our in-depth look at Midjourney and Stable Diffusion. We will cover topics such as textual inversion, negative prompting, weighted prompts, prompt blending, and how to train your own model.

# Lesson 5 - Getting Familiar with GAN

**Summary** - In this lesson, we will take a look at how GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) are used to create and enhance art. We will go over GFPGAN, StyleGAN, ESRGAN, VQGAN+CLIP, and SFTGAN.
